## STEM workshop reading bluetooth beacons


## Install bluetooth software
### Older instructions
There seems to be many different tutorials that seem to suggest many different packages need to be installed.

### Older documentation seems to suggest:
```
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez-utils blueman bluez-hcidump
```
### New document seems to suggest:
```
sudo apt-get install bluez python-gobject python-dbus
```
and maybe:
```
sudo apt-get install bluez-utils
```
It seems like this is important:
```
sudo apt-get install python-bluez
```
